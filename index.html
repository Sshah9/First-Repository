      <h3><strong>Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!</strong></h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:30px;"> So goes the title of his book where he collected his adventures. He was born in Queens, New York City on May 11th to Lucille Phillips and Melville Feynman. Since an early age, he was influenced by his father to question everything. His questioning nature, though it sometimes ruffled feathers of those around him, later helped him cultivate a curious mind and ultimately that was the root of his genius. Besides his pioneering feats in quantum physics, he also dabbled in non-scientific inquiry like philosophy, art, music and various mysticisms in an effort to learn as much as he could about the world and the human beings that reside in it. Richard Feynman was not only, a great physicist, but also a great thinker of recent times. He has imparted many lessons to us via his work in physics, his lectures, his books and recorded dialogues. Richard Feynman is a treasure trove of inspiration and so he should be revered as one for ages to come.</p>
      <h4 class="text-justified"><strong>A brief time-line of his impressive career:</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1939: </strong>Received Bachelor of Science from MIT and became a Putnam Fellow.</li>
        <li><strong>1942: </strong>Awarded Doctor of Philosophy from Princeton University.</li>
        <li><strong>1942 to 1945: </strong>Worked on the secretive WW2 groundbreaking and game-changing Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and at Oak Ridge.</li>
        <li><strong>1945 to 1950: </strong>Joined Cornell University physics department and taught theoretical physics.</li>
        <li><strong>1950: </strong>Joined the faculty in the physics department at Caltech. Feynman conducted his research in quantum electrodynamics and the physics of superfluidity.</li>
        <li><strong>1965: </strong>Received the Nobel Prize in Physics for work in quantum electrodynamics, along with international collaborative scientists colleagues Julian Schwinger and Shinichiro Tomonaga.</li>
        <li><strong>1979: </strong>Awarded the US National Medal of Science award.</li>
        <li><strong>1986: </strong>Consulted for the US Congress instituted Rogers Commission during the investigation of the Challenger space disaster.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:30px;"> On Feb 15th 1988, Richard Feynman died aged 69, battling with liposarcoma and duodenal ulcer in Los Angeles, California. He is survived by his two children, Carl and Michelle.</p>
